# Variables
A variable is used to store information in memory that we can use later.

To use variables we must declare them and start them.

To declare a variable explicitly we use the following syntax:

type identifier;
int varName;

The type is the type of data that stores the variable, it can be an integer, character string, date, boolean, etc ...

The identifier is the name of the variable
